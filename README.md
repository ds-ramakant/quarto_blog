# Hi there 👋🏼

Hello world, I'm a media & marketing professional with a wide variety of experience in (broadcast TV) and digital (OTT) sides. Since the lockdown in 2020, I have turned quite curious towards data science and am keen to learn and apply cutting-edge analytical concepts to the media business.

This blog is my way of reaching out to the world in search of like-minded to learn and grow.

My website is www.ds-ramakant.com and all the code resides on this github repo.
