    "text": "Who ever thought that a bunch of black and green boxes would bring out the logophile in us all? With friends and family groups sharing their progress, I find this to be an entertaining mind-puzzle to kickstart the day.\nAnd I was not alone in my quest for 5 letter words. Wordle has tickled the fascination of many in the data science community. I found Arthur Holtz’s lucid breakdown of the Wordle dataset quite interesting. Of course, there is 3B1B’s incredibly detailed videos on applying Information Theory to this 6-by-5 grid. (original video as well as the follow-up errata)\nOthers have simulated the wordle game (like here) or even solved it for you (like this blog). I’ve read at least one blog post that has an academic take on the matter.\nFortunately for the reader, none of the above will be attempted by me. My inspiration comes from Gerry Chng’s Frequency Analysis Approach where I’ve tried to understand the most commonly occuring letters in the official word list by position by considering a ranking mechanism"

Now I’m curious to know the top words by each position. To do this, I created a single table called freq_table that provides me with the frequency of occurrences by position for each letter. To iterate this process across all the 5 places, I used a for loop.

Now sprinkling some magic courtesy ggplot\n\nSide note on reordering within facets\nI tried my best to understand why I was unable to sort within each facet in spite of using free_y. Apparently that’s a known issue and a workaround has been discussed by David Robinson, Julia Silger and Tyler Rinker. To achieve this, two more functions need to be created reorder_within and scale_y_reordered\n\n\nCode\nreorder_within <- function(x, by, within, fun = mean, sep = \"___\", ...) {\n  new_x <- paste(x, within, sep = sep)\n  stats::reorder(new_x, by, FUN = fun)\n}\n\nscale_y_reordered <- function(..., sep = \"___\") {\n  reg <- paste0(sep, \".+$\")\n  ggplot2::scale_y_discrete(labels = function(x) gsub(reg, \"\", x), ...)\n}\n\nfreq_table_long10 %>% \n  mutate(type = case_when(alpha %in% c(\"A\",\"E\",\"I\",\"O\",\"U\") ~ \"vowel\",\n                          T ~ \"consonant\")) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(y = reorder_within(alpha, freq, position), x = freq))+\n  geom_col(aes(fill = type))+\n  scale_y_reordered()+\n  facet_wrap(~position, \n             scales = \"free_y\", \n             ncol = 5)+\n  labs(x = \"Frequency\", y = \"Letter\",\n       title = \"Frequency of top 10 letters by position in Official Wordle list \",\n       caption = \"D.S.Ramakant Raju\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/dsramakant/\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAha! Things are starting to get more clearer. Highly common letters in the 1st position are S, C, B, T and P - notice there’s only 1 vowel (A) that occurs in the top 10. Vowels appear more frequently in the 2nd and 3rd positions. Last position has a higher occurrence of E, Y, T, R & L"

    "text": "Which words can be the best Worlde openers?\nArmed with the above knowledge, we now can filter out the commonly occurring words. Also I use a naive method to rank these words basis the occurrence of the letters. For instance, in the picture above, the word S A I N T seems to be a valid word comprising of the top occurring letters.\nAdmittedly, I use a pretty crude method to determine the best openers. Known drawbacks of this methodology are:\n\nDoesn’t consider the future path of the word (number of steps to get to the right word)\nOnly considers the rank of the letters and not the actual probability of occurrence\n\nWith that out of the way, I was able to determine that there are 39 words that can be formed with the top 5 occurring letters in each position. I’ve created a score that is determined by the rank of each letter within its position. For instance, S A I N T gets a score of 9 by summing up 1 (S in first position) + 1 (A in second position) + 2 (I in third) + 2 (N in fourth) + 3 (T in fifth). The lower the score, the higher the frequency of occurrences.

Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense. There’s far more competition for the #1 spot in the last 20 years which is driving down the longevity. Compare the 50’s to the 2010’s and the trend is hard to miss. This table is only for the books that made it to the #1 position. But how about the rest of the other books?
