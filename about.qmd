I am an independent marketing consultant 16+ years experience across Marketing, Business & Analytics teams in consumer companies. I specialise in helping founders understand how to build revenue growth levers with marketing channels and remain invested in long term marketing efforts.

Throughout my professional journey I've helped businesses solve for user acquisition, engagement and revenue - from entertainment powerhouses like MX Player & Viu to smaller, nimble footed startups like Turno selling Electric Vehicles. I am passionate about being at the intersection of marketing, consumer insights and analytics while working alongside teams to bring growth ideas to life. Fluent in English, Hindi & Telugu. My favourite weekend activity is to switch off the laptop and spend time with my family exploring Mumbai 👨‍👩‍👧

## Why the Null Hypothesis?

British Nobel-laureate Ronald Coase famously said **"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything."** True words that ring loudly in any digital-first company. As someone who's cut their teeth in quantitative research, I firmly it is consumer behaviour & insight that is sacred and we must seek it out with the help of data (big or small).

In statistics, the null hypothesis conjecture is the first step to begin any inferential analysis. Similarly, I begin every growth project with a null hypothesis to help me understand the consumer better. The hope is to document and share my learnings through this journal.
