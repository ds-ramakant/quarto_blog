Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Ramakant and I am a consumer marketing enthusiast with a natural curiosity towards data and technology. I started this blog as a way to sharpen my data science skills and occasionally pour those creative juices.

That's me sitting on the steps of the Sydney Opera house trying to give my best touristy look. If you'd like to know more about my bio, please continue to the [About Me page](https://www.ds-ramakant.com/about.html)

## Get In Touch ✍️

I'm always on the lookout for a good conversation. Feel free to mail me at `d.s.ramakant@gmail.com` or check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsramakant/)
