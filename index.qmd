Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Ramakant and I've always had a natural curiosity towards consumer, data and technology.

Five words to describe myself are – Restless, Resourceful, Passionate, Grounded and Empathetic.

I'm an independent marketing consultant based out of Mumbai helping brands and companies with revenue-led marketing efforts.

Welcome to my personal blog of random musings on marketing & other stuff.

You will find more [about me on this page](https://www.ds-ramakant.com/about.html).
