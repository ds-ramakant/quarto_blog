Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Ramakant and I am a digital marketing enthusiast with a natural curiosity towards data and technology. I started this blog as a way to sharpen my data science skills and occasionally pour out those creative juices.

Feel free to explore the topics below - possibly a fraction what's on my mind these days. (rest are in the drafts.. or worse - unwritten😄). [The About Me page](https://www.ds-ramakant.com/about.html) has more details about my professional qualifications and my motivation to create this site.

## Get In Touch ✍️

I'm always on the lookout for a good conversation. Feel free to mail me at `d.s.ramakant@gmail.com` or check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsramakant/). If you'd like to leave comments, please click on tab on the right 👉🏼
