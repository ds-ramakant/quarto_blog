## Tidy Tuesday, Week 19 (2022)

"Learn by practice!" is a maxim that every coder/analyst agrees upon. One of the admirable initiatives by the R/ RStudio community is [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) - every week a new dataset is released for enthusiasts to dig into. A few days back, an interesting dataset caught my eye - [NYT's Bestsellers List](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/readme.md) from 1930 to 2021. This one was particularly unique as it mirrored a lot of projects that I've been doing on the OTT side as well. So I cracked my knuckles and jumped right in!

## Objective

1.  Understanding longevity & seasonality of how books track on the NYT bestseller's list
2.  Deeper understanding of using customizing themes and fonts on the ggplot package

### Loading the data

Starting off by loading the data and the libraries

```{r extracting and cleaning, echo=T, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
suppressMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(scales)
  library(knitr)
  library(tidytuesdayR)
  library(forcats)
  library(lubridate)
  library(RColorBrewer)
})

tt_raw <- tt_load("2022-05-10")
data <- tt_raw$nyt_titles
```

What's in the Tidy Tuesday dataset?

```{r}
glimpse(data)
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (sort of)

Quick EDA tells us that there the number of books in the #1 spot each year during the 50s have been increasing while the number of weeks they've spent on the NYT list has been decreasing. 2020-21 is excluded as I'm breaking up the period into decades for easy analysis

```{r EDA, echo = T}

data %>% 
  mutate(decade = factor(10*year %/% 10)) %>% 
  filter(best_rank==1, year<2020) %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  summarise(avg_weeks = mean(total_weeks),
            no_of_rank1 = n_distinct(title))

```

This is a fantastic starting point. Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense. There's far more competition for the #1 spot in the last 20 years which is driving down the longevity. Compare the 50's to the 2010's and the trend is hard to miss. This table is only for the books that made it to the #1 position. But how about the rest of the other books? A visual representation draws the same conclusion more elegantly.

### Visualising Longevity

Hat-tip to a few outstanding viz I came across while researching the NYT theme. [Bob Rudis' Supreme Annotations](https://rud.is/b/2016/03/16/supreme-annotations/) and [Rahul Sangole's Visualizing Correlations](https://rsangole.netlify.app/posts/2021-04-13-30-day-chart-challenge/2021-04-13-30-day-chart-challenge)

```{r Longevity, echo= T, warning=FALSE}

#loading fonts that resemble the NYT viz
#inspired by https://rud.is/b/2016/03/16/supreme-annotations/

library(showtext)
showtext_auto()
font_add(family = "Open Sans", 
         regular = "OpenSans-CondLight.ttf", 
         italic = "OpenSans-CondLightItalic.ttf", 
         bold = "OpenSans-CondBold.ttf")

#changing facet labels as shown here 
#https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/as_labeller.html
facet_labels <- as_labeller(c(`1930`= "1930 to 1939",
                              `1940`= "1940 to 1949",
                              `1950`= "1950 to 1959",
                              `1960`= "1960 to 1969",
                              `1970`= "1970 to 1979",
                              `1980`= "1980 to 1989",
                              `1990`= "1990 to 1999",
                              `2000`= "2000 to 2009",
                              `2010`= "2010 to 2019"))


#annotations for individual facet as discussed here https://stackoverflow.com/a/11889798/7938068
annot_x <- data.frame(debut_rank = 5, 
                      total_weeks = 111,
                      lab = "Each dot\n is a book",
                      decade = 1940)

graph1 <- data %>% 
  filter(best_rank==1,year<2020) %>% 
  mutate(decade = factor(10*year %/% 10)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = debut_rank, y  = total_weeks))+
  geom_point(aes(color = decade, group = debut_rank))+
  facet_grid(~decade ,labeller = facet_labels)

            )

### Visualising Seasonality

Now lets look at seasonality - is there any trend as far as the launch month is concerned? For the sake of analysis, I've truncated the analysis period to 2010 onwards to keep it more relevant and exlcude irrelvant historical data.

```{r Seasonality, echo = T, warning=FALSE}

graph2 <- data %>% 
  filter(best_rank<11, year> 2010) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(first_week, label = T),
         stage = case_when(year<=2015 ~ "2011-2015",
                           year> 2015 ~ "2016-2020",
                           T ~ "x")) %>% 
  group_by(stage,year,month) %>% 
  summarise(n = n_distinct(title)) %>% 
  mutate(all_titles = ave(n, year, FUN = sum),
         pct = n/all_titles) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = pct, group = 1))+
  geom_point(size = 2, 
             alpha = 0.5, position = "jitter")+
  geom_smooth(se = T) 


graph2 <- graph2+
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Open Sans")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")+
  labs(title = "Monthly seasonality of books that featured in the top 10 of NYT Bestsellers list (2010-2021)", 
       subtitle = "Books launched in Summer (Apr-May) or Fall (Sep-Oct) were more likely to make it feature in the top 10",
       caption = "TidyTuesday Week 19, 2022\n Prepared by D.S.Ramakant Raju, www.ds-ramakant.com",
       x = "Months (2010-2019)",
       y = "%age of books launched within that year")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1),
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 0.2, by= 0.05), 
                     limits = c(0,0.15))+
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color = "grey"),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())

graph2
```

This is a fairly straightforward and replicable analysis. If you're a #TidyTuesday fan please feel free to share your work in the comments below
