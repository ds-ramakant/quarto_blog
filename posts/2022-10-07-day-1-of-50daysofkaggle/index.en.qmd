Introducing my own personal sprint training [[[**"50 Days of Kaggle"**]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}](https://www.kaggle.com/dsramakant)

The task is simple:

1.  Improve Kaggle score by the end of 50 days
2.  Work on ML models daily. Try interacting on the portal as much as possible.
3.  Keep ISLR notes handy. Blog over here for revision
4.  Use Python. Or else use R Tidymodels. (neither of which I am currently proficient in)

I'd want to use this blog to journal my progress. Hopefully by 26th Nov'22, I'd have improved from where I'm starting out.

So what do we have for Day 1?

# [The Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview "Baby Step #1")

Everyone's first starting point. And I'm slowly starting to appreciate why. Lets see if we can read the data directly into this notebook

## Reading the data

First things first, import libraries

```{python}
import requests
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import kaggle

kaggle.api.authenticate()
```

*Note to self:* below command did not work

```{python}
#kaggle.api.dataset_download_files("titanic", path = ".", unzip = True)
```

However, this one does as per this link <https://www.kaggle.com/general/138914>

```{python}
kaggle.api.competition_download_files("titanic", path = ".")
```

This pulls the .zip file in the local folder. because this is a zip file, we need package called `zipfile`(note to self: don't forget the console command `reticulate::py_install("zipfile")`)

<https://stackoverflow.com/a/56786517/7938068>

Reading and checking the first rows of `train`

```{python}
import zipfile

zf = zipfile.ZipFile("titanic.zip")
train = pd.read_csv(zf.open("train.csv"))
test = pd.read_csv(zf.open("test.csv"))
train.head()
```

Checking the first rows of `test`

```{python}
test.head()
```

This took me a whole day to figure out. End of Day1 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
