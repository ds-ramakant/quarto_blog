Today's post is an attempt to use the `tidymodels` framework to screen multiple models. Inspiration for this post comes from the [Ch 15 of the Tidymodels with R textbook](https://www.tmwr.org/workflow-sets.html) along with two more noteworthy blogs

-   [Olivier Gimenez's post](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/learning-machine-learning/) that had me marvelling at the feature engineering
-   [Tural Sadigov's post](https://rpubs.com/tsadigov/titanic_tidymodels) on handling multiple models

# EDA

what about ticket number and fare? investigate into ticket number and check for families that are travelling together

1.  combine ticket_id and fare as suggested [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jack89roberts/titanic-using-ticket-groupings/comments#337002)
2.  also check the titanic mega model [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/titantic-mega-model-0-84210/notebook)
