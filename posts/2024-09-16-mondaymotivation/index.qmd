Robert Louis Stevenson said very rightly:

> *Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant*

At this point in time, its about putting in effort daily and not even thinking about the results.

Here's what keeping me motivated this week:

-   Cracked my personal best 10k with a surprisingly good performance. Shaved off 4 full minutes from two weeks ago. This came at the cost of very high HR. Serious area of concern.
-   Sustained micro-journaling is helping me make most use of my day as productively as possible. Next bet is on content generation on this site.
