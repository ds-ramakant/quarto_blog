# Monday Motivation: Answer Their Call

Today's Monday Motivation post is a call to action. [Events of last week](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/26-year-old-employees-mother-writes-letter-to-ey-chairman-annas-death-should-serve-as-a-wake-up-call-for-ey/articleshow/113445667.cms) left me disturbed and I reflected on my own behaviour.

A Faustian bargain is a tragic deal where more is lost than gained. A young magician named Faust makes a deal with the devil to unlock great magic but ultimately sells his soul in return. Office going folks will find this tale oddly familiar. While we slog those long hours in office, we silently mourn the loss of time - away from our dreams, our family, our loved ones who need us more.

The past 1.5 years where I've been away from family made me realise a lot of mistakes that I made. And in the past 1.5 years, I've tried to correct myself by doing the one thing that I guess I should done all along - ***answer the call***. Whenever my family rang in I'd answer the call. And I urged my team-members to do the same. If it was an important meeting, at the very least I'd message back and call back later.

**Answer Their Call.**

Your company will only check if you've logged in on time. It will not check if you've had dinner or reached home on time. Only your family will.

**Answer Their Call.**

No matter what the situation, I urge you all to #AnswerTheirCall. Talk to your team and colleagues about this more often.

**Answer Their Call.**

Tell yourself its ok to prioritise this for a few minutes. Give your brain more signals to correct the work life balance. We surround ourselves 15 hours a day for years together that our brains have been conditioned to behave obediently.

**Answer Their Call.**
