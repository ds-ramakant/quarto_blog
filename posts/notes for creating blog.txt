Rstudio not opening 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74883944/rstudio-is-not-opening-just-shows-the-rstudio-logo
uninstalled R For Windows 4.2.3 from the system
go to windows explorer and find rstudio.exe > right-click and go to 'compatability' tab> click on 'run compatability troubleshooter' > selected 64-bit R 4.4.1  > apply recommended settings

site is still down. going thru netlify forums. here are some key threads
https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-compiled-build-and-deploy-resources-start-here/50679

finally got it to work. but I published it directly from R terminal using the following command
	quarto publish netlify --id 4eb6da0d-6b9b-4d20-ac33-ce0cc533b48

check this link https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#continuous-integration


unfortunately seemed to have created a new website by mistake (https://comforting-speculoos-cf7ff6.netlify.app/) 

button greying out. use manual push
https://forum.posit.co/t/push-and-pull-buttons-for-git-are-not-enabled-in-rstudio/19842/4

now a new problem has surfaced. thought it was about using uppercase in the folder name. so deleted bad folder and created a new folder with today's date and lowercase. Problem is the new folder is not visible in the github repo. able to see commit messages but the folder is missing

SOLVED IT!!! 
most probably some kind of client issue with RStudio. use the following commands
	git status 
		\\ find files that are untracked. most recent post is not being commited for 	some reason
		\\ latest post needs to be visible in 'posts' and '_site'
	git add posts/2024-08-22-restart
	git add _site/posts/2024-08-22-restart
	git commit -a --message "using git add in terminal"
	git push origin main

worked immediately after this. alternatively try:
	git add -A
	git add --all
	git add .

trying to restart the blog from neha's college Dell laptop. managed to update R & Rstudio and make changes to the most recent post. however, the last two posts "Day 15..." and "Back after a while" are still facing 404 errors. trying to setup the git account and faced invalid username/pwd error at time of pushing on git

Personal Access Token : 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

something doesn't seem to be working. deleted a folder and created another one. but still the last 2 posts are showing 404 error. these two posts were published on quarto blog after Apr '24


Went to Netlify Site Configuration settings. Changed node.js version from 16.x to 18.x under 'Dependency Management'
https://app.netlify.com/sites/ds-ramakant/configuration/deploys#content

opened terminal. rendered the entire site again using this command
	quarto render
	
Something seems to be wrong with the publishing. the site is getting rendered perfectly in the local host
(http://localhost:4621/posts/2024-08-05-Restart/index.html). Same is visible on the git hub page but not on netlify. still incomplete as of 20240805. here are the resources that I last checked

Writing a function to create a new blogpost

logging into github after a year. got this message when i tried gitcreds_get(). Looks like i'm still logged in
> gitcreds::gitcreds_get()
<gitcreds>
  protocol: https
  host    : github.com
  username: ds-ramakant
  password: <-- hidden -->

unable to commit because getting this error
//
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'Admin@Ramakant.(none)')
//

checking this page --> https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git
git config --global user.name "ds-ramakant"
git config --global user.email "d.s.ramakant@gmail.com"

use name and the email associated with your GitHub account.

created a qmd file. then rendered it. seemed to be working ok. 
tried this next from the terminal:
git commit -a --message "attempt #5 from terminal"
git push origin main

these two pushed the latest blog posts. it is see only on the homepage but the main posts don't seem to be working. need to check on this later in the weekend.

steps to shift the github repo on netlify
1) goto site settings. click on "build and deploy" https://app.netlify.com/sites/ds-ramakant/settings/deploys
2) click on edit settings
3) follow the instructions mentioned here --> https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#publish-from-git-provider
	a) leave "build command" empty [chatgpt was wrong about this]
	b) in publish directory enter "_site" 
that's it. blog is live now!

Google analytics
1) created a new property called Quarto RStudio
	Measurement ID:G-T5T39KBDW1
2) added that with single quotes in the _quarto.yaml file 

Enabling comments using Hypothes.is
To enable Disqus on quarto would mean tweaking around with some JS code. Too much of work for me. 
Hypothes.is (https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting) as suggested in the Quarto docmumentation is a super clean alternative. It is cleaner to look (comments and needs sign-in to post.

https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/get-started-quarto/materials/04-static-documents.html#/css
ppt from rstudio workshop to build quarto document

Figured a super cool way to change the font type in quarto document. 
first method is to do an inline using following code:
	[insert text here]{style = "font-family: serif; font-size: 14px"}
	check YT video that this doc made just for me! --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2WJqxhT8sc
second method is to create a custom class ID in the styles.css file. follow these steps
	a) make a custom class in the styles.css file like this 
			.my-jobexp {
					  font-family: serif; 
					  font-size: 14px
					}
	b) go to the quarto document (about.qmd) and add this in the YAML header with indentation
		output:
			quarto::html_document:
				css: styles.css
	c) use the custom class in this syntax
		-   [text 1]{style= "font-family: courier; color: blue; font-size: 12px"}
		-   [text 2]{.my-jobexp}
		-   [text 3]
text1 will be in blue color
text2 will be as defined in the styles.css file
text3 will be default text
>>>>>NOTE: UNABLE TO REPRODUCE ABOVE 3 EXAMPLES IN THE SAME DOCUMENT BECAUSE INLINE CSS FORMATTING IS NOT WORKING ONCE styles.css IS DECALRED IN YAML HEADER<<<<< 


2023 02 15
Inheriting YAML headers. put defaults in the _metadata.yaml file as recommended here --> https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/#inheriting-yaml-settings

trying my hand at re-building and moving to Quarto blog. Why?
	a) python code & visualisation don't seem to be appearing correctly in Rmarkdown 
	b) Quarto seems neater
	c) catalyst to do something with the blog

Step 1: download Quarto. update R & RStudio
Step 2: create Quartopub account. (ds-ramakant)
Step 3: create new blog project in Rstudio

other customisations:
index.qmd
	added brief summary along with contact info
about.qmd
	more details here https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates

2023 01 29

checking PAT credentials for github: https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#tldr
since the push/pull buttons keep getting greyed out, i type the following commands in the terminal
git remote -v #checks for the origin path to fetch and push
git push origin main #git push [remote-name] [branch-name]

normally these two commands do the trick as all the files get uploaded on the github immediately

If you want to turn off messages and warnings in the whole document you can use this code chunk right after the yaml portion.

working with git on rstudio is very broken. push/pull buttons are greyed out so typing git commands thru the terminal

rstudio either keeps hanging/ doesn't quit/ history window is empty. another problem is when i made a small change to the readme.txt file on the git repo and wasn't able to pull and then push leading to 'Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit' error. Answers on this query were insightful

integrated the git repository with netlify. some important links
https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/

while delegating to netlify, the only change i made was on the 'Name Servers'
dns1.p01.nsone.net
dns2.p01.nsone.net
dns3.p01.nsone.net
dns4.p01.nsone.net
check 'Name Servers' at https://app.netlify.com/teams/d-s-ramakant/dns/ds-ramakant.com

added disqus comments on the site. registered and chose the free version. followed the instructions posted here

shortname entered in the params.yaml file is 'ds-ramakant'
